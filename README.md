# Superstore Sales Dashboard


## Research Question 

#### What problem(s) are you going to try to solve? 

- Identify sales trends and patterns across different regions and customer segments. 
- Analyze the performance of product categories and sub-categories in terms of sales, quantity sold, and profit. 
- Determine the effectiveness of discounts in driving sales and impacting profits. 
- Assess shipping modes concerning shipping efficiency (time taken from order to ship) and customer satisfaction. 
### Methodology 
#### How do you intend to answer your research question? 
#### Data Sets to be Used: 
- The Sample Superstore Sales dataset will be the primary data source, encompassing all variables mentioned (Order ID, Customer ID, etc.).

#### Data Preparation and Cleaning: 
- Use Power BI's data transformation tools to clean and prepare the dataset, such as handling missing values, converting data types, and creating calculated columns if necessary (e.g., shipping time calculated from Order Date and Ship Date). 
#### Data Analysis: 
- Perform exploratory data analysis using Power BI visualizations to understand distributions and relationships among different variables. 
#### Segment analysis: 
- Compare sales, profit, and discount trends across different customer segments and regions. 
#### Category analysis: 
- Evaluate the performance of various product categories and sub-categories. 
#### Time series analysis: 
- Analyze sales and profit trends over time to identify seasonal patterns or growth trends. 
#### Dashboard Creation: 
- Develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI that allows users to filter and drill down into specific segments, regions, categories, or periods. Include visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps for geographic analysis. 
#### Compute Resources Needed: 
- A computer with Power BI Desktop installed. Adequate processing power and memory to handle data manipulation and visualization tasks, especially if the dataset is large. 
### Expected Results:
#### What are you hoping to achieve by the end of this term? 
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides clear insights into sales performance, customer behaviour, and 
product profitability. 
Identification of key drivers of sales and profit within the superstore's operations. 
Recommendations for business strategies based on data-driven insights, such as which products to promote, which 
regions to focus on, or how to adjust discount strategies. 
Enhanced understanding of the relationship between shipping modes and customer satisfaction or sales efficiency. 
Ability to make data-backed decisions to improve the overall performance of the superstore. 
This approach will help in utilizing the dataset effectively to derive meaningful insights and support business 
decision-making processes.
